![Header/intro section for the Huddle landing page with curved sections](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

AUTHOR NOTES:
- used grid for the features section and flexbox for overall layout
- for the curves, I used pseudo-elements selector and specified the ff:
    content:"";
    background-image: url();
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    height: 254px;
    width: 100%
    transform: translateY(depends on the image)
